# Inventory

The number of items you have available during an encounter is determined by your Wits; the total number of items you can carry is determined by your Might. Any items that are considered _ready_ you can interact with as at will. Items in your _carry_ slots are inaccessible during combat unless you take an action to retrieve them.  Consult the following charts to determine a character ready/carry slots:

## Ready Slots

| Debilitating         | 2     |
| Weak                 | 3     |
| Ordinary             | 4     |
| Exceptional          | 5     |
| Peerless             | 6     |
