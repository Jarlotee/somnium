# Introduction

## What is Somnium?

Somnium, derived from the Latin word for dream, is a set of rules and concepts for tabletop role-playing (TTRPG). Its system is designed to be rules-light in order to promote character development, imaginative flair, and storytelling. By design there are no classes, spells, kits, xp, or other automatic means of progressions. Instead guidelines are provided to facilitate that character creation and evolution process. Players ought to be motivated to engage in role-playing and explore the game world, rather than being constrained by a character sheet's predetermined abilities and attributes. 

Essentially, Somnium aims to revive the most favorable elements of the 70s and 80s, while discarding the unwieldy complexity and brutal mistakes of the past.


### Why another role-playing game?

As games such as Dungeons and Dragons have been around for decades, profit-seeking corporations have aimed to maximize revenue by expanding their cadre of merchandise, rules, and content. This phenomenon has led to many TTRPG systems being perceived and playedÂ  like video games. Consequently, our creativity and enjoyment are constricted by the boundaries of additional content. If you prefer a pre-scripted adventure that provides the illusion of choice, you are depriving yourself of the enchanting and dynamic universe that you, your game master and fellow adventurers create together.

Tabletop role-playing centers on the journey rather than the destination. It is not a game to be won; rather, it is a shared storytelling experience where each participant contributes their creativity, vision, and aspirations. Through that collective narrative, you bring our dreams to life and create memories that will last a lifetime.


### Play Style

- The world is dangerous and your survival is not assured by an artificial construct of balanced encounters or level design. However, not every careless step or failed resistance check should mean an ignominious end. Scouting, planning and avoiding unnecessary combat is rewarded.


- While heroes can be categorized by archetypes or themes, we should avoid the tendency to mass manufacture them. They are and should be unique in terms of background, disposition, aesthetic and power.


- Exploration, social encounters, mentors, tasks, trials, dungeons, politics, wars and puzzles should be used liberally and with variety to bring a rich and engaging story to life.


- Player characters have motivations and dreams. They should influence the tide of events rather than being swept up in them.


- Logistics including training, followers, hirelings, apprentices, vehicles, fiefs and more give meaning and permanence to the world. Great people are defined by not just what they do, but what they hold and how they care for and interact with others.

- Dice are primarly used to determine random effects, not hide or reveal secrets. Avoid the tendency of rolling for things like lore, insight, relgion, etc. Include characters experience and training in narative explinations and allow players to engage directly with the world.
