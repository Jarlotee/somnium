## Dice Rolling Notation

Dice are used in many TTRPG’s to indicate fate or otherwise randomize results. Randomness creates both variety to play and storytelling and can indicate luck or fate.

Where:

- d4: 4-sided die
- d6: 6-sided die
- d8: 8-sided die
- d10: 10-sided die
- d12: 12-sided die
- d20: 20-sided die

When multiple dice should be rolled you will see the number of dice notated on the left side

Where:

- 2d4: Roll two, four-sided die
- 10d6: Roll then, six-sided die


### Percentile Dice (d100)

Percentile dice is typically made of a standard 10-sided die and a special 10-sided die with the following markings 00, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90.

Where:

- 00+1: 1
- 00+0: 10 
- 90+1: 1
- 90+0: 100 


### Advantage & Disadvantage

For a roll at advantage you will roll the requested dice and take the higher number. Rolling at disadvantage will require you to roll the requested dice and take the lower total.


### Emphasis Roll

An emphasis roll is called when the outcome of an action is deemed to be a catastrophic failure or success. Roll 3d6 and group the dice by 3 and below and 4 and above. The higher dice count indicates the result.


### Skill, Ability, and Resistance Checks

Generally these checks are expressed by rolling a certain number of D6 and taking the highest or lowest result. Where:

|              |                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Result**   | **Resistance or Ability Check** |
| Multiple 1’s | Worst Outcome                   |
| 1, 2, 3      | Bad Outcome                     |
| 4, 5         | Good Outcome                    |
| 6            | Great Outcome                   |
| Multiple 6’s | Best Outcome                    |
