## Creating a Character

You will need a piece of paper, a character sheet, or another place to record the details of your character for future reference.Â 

It is recommended to start your adventure as a non-adventurer and to let the story and your character's motivations guide the development of your hero. A non-adventurer may select one skill or tool proficiency but would have minimal equipment, experience and no abilities.


### Attributes

It is recommended that you select at least one attribute as a weakness and select another attribute as exceptional. The rest of your attributes can remain ordinary.


### Note Guard and Wounds

Each character starts with 3 in Guard and 3 in Wounds.

_Optional rule: If a character has weakness or strength in the Resolve attribute you may treat it as a modifier to Guard. If a character has weakness or strength in the Vitality attribute you may treat it as a modifier to wounds._


### Select Proficiencies

Every character starts with one language proficiency (their own spoken language) and may select two additional proficiencies in languages, tools, or skills. See the proficiencies section for examples.


### Wealth and Equipment

Roll 3d6 x 10 silver pieces. You may spend as much of this money as desired on adventuring equipment by consulting the equipment list below. If you wish to purchase something not on the list, consult your GM on its availability and cost.


### Note Damage Reduction

If you have armor or other items that grant damage reduction note the reduction amount and type.


### Note Adventuring Level

Generally player characters start as a non-adventurer.


### Name Character and Consider Motivations

Note the character's given name including any applicable clan or family name. If desired this name can be an alias if the character has a criminal history or is in hiding. Titles and nicknames should be avoided outside of the storytelling process.

Consider why your character is willing to risk life and limb doing things the average person would avoid. Do they have a debt to repay? Want to change the world? Seek fortune and glory? Motivation can give your character flavor and help role-play their present and future.
