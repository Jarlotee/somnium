# Fate

Fate represents the super natural abilities of characters and creatures in the world.

Rather than charges or static class abilities, techniques and magical items are powered by a character's fate points.

You might spend a fate point to reroll a die in hopes of a different outcome or spend a point to summon a blinding light in front of an attacker that catches you off-guard.


## Abilities

As a character interacts with the world they will come across special items, tomes and mentors that can train and assist them in their journey.  As the character accepts and practices these abilities they transcend the normal constraints of humanity. To some degree these abilities define them as a hero. 

Inspiration can be drawn from tropes and traditional fantasy archetypes but variation and customization should be encouraged. Consult with your player to understand how their character is evolving and how it intersects with the setting and story. It is up to the GM to provide options and the player to accept and interact with those options. As a player you should remain flexible in the vision of your character and as a GM you should keep one eye on balance (i.e. not breaking the game) and the other on fulfilling the dreams of your players. Neither the player or the GM should force a specific build or flavor.

As a rule of thumb it is recommended that a character have access to two fate abilities for every adventuring level. Avoid the temptation of granting an ability explicitly because of a milestone or to keep a player artificially engaged. 

Each fate ability is powered by fate points. The more fate points spent the stronger the manifestation of said ability. Fate points can also be used to extend the normal bounds or conceptual design of the ability. For example making an ability harder to resist, more damaging, affect more creatures or a larger area.

If a creature is willing to accept the fate ability no roll is required. If the creature is unwilling the affected creature makes a resistance check using a relevant attribute.

You can use the following guidelines to create fate abilities for each character.

## Other Uses

Abilities are powered by fate points but there are many more ways a character can utilize their allotted fate. Generally a character can trade fate points for narrative and mechanical luck. As a GM be careful not to dismiss a character wanting to spend fate to turn the tides of the story in their favor. Consider how you can use resource spend to create drama and interest and tell a better story. Here is a non-exhaustive list of ways a character can spend fate points:

- Add an additional die to a skill check or guarantee the best possible outcome
- Add an additional die to a resistance check, or guarantee the best possible outcome
- Reroll damage dice
- Move farther than would normally be allowed in a turn
- Receive knowledge, help, etc. from a patron
- Find a hidden door
- Extend the behavior or characteristics of an ability or skill

As a GM you will have to use your judgment on how the fate points spent will affect the story and outcomes. Do your best to remain consistent. As a player you should be respectful of the story and the other participants.
