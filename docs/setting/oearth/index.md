Oerth is known as the home world of Orcs, Elves and Dwarves. Here their creator Gods Gruumsh, Muradin and Corellon gifted the breath of life to their children, passed on beliefs and set them to subdue the untamed world.

## Genesis and Abandonment

![God Zarus](../../images/god-zarus.png){ align=right }

It was the lawful evil God Zarus who introduced humanity to Oerth. Zarus engendered humanity with zeal, a desire to evolve into something greater than the sum of its parts. He took wisps from the magic of elves, the ferocity of orcs, the industry of dwarves, and molded his own people. It was Zarus' intention to create perfection through industry, study, and domination. Humanities god-given drive helped them quickly establish a foothold in the lush coasts. The great human empire, Sulm, was founded on the worship and ideals of Zarus.

Sulm enslaved other races, created thralls and castes that would handle lesser tasks so they could focus on their various pursuits of perfections. Shattados the last king of the Sulm empire believed that variation of thought or purpose was the greatest obstical to humanities perfection. He spent vast resources toward this problem, subjecting slaves with horrific experiments. Ultimatly his high-priest recieved a strange vision where in a saw the king participate in a ritualan artifact known as the Scorpian's Crown. With the power of the crown he could link and dominate the minds of his subjects to create a single human conscienceness, perfect unity. Tharizdun the destroyer of all provided both the vision and the crown.

The ritual succeded but the results were catastrophic. Shattados merged with the dark artifact gaining vast psionic powers. The king's perfect human form was twisted into the shape of the crowns namesake, a giant scorpian. His empire, now permanently linked with their king morphed into human-scorpian hybrids, even the land around them started to change.

Shattados prepared sacrifices to Zarus to plead for help in restoring the people to their true forms but when the God looked down on his progeny he no longer saw his perfect children but twisted monsters. Zarus abandoned the empire and all humanity as a failed experiment, beleiving mortals naturally corruptable and became reclusive to Oearth.



## Salvation

The last vestiges of human culture lay to the north-west in Velverdyva Valley with the human bandit lords. They lived in squallor, raping and killing, a blight on the otherwise beautiful and balanced lands. Humanity suffered, lost and directionless seeing generations of wars and raids without progress or hope.

It was The Dawn Father who ultimatley had compassion on humanity. Pelor sent a drought among the human tribes eliminating the hunting and foraging they used for sustenance. The God of the Sun would see humanity learn to cultivate and cooperate or continue to raid and fight until their strength was spent and their death assured. Muradin wagered Pelor that humanity would be dead within a generation.

Humanity nearly did end. Within five years war and raiding amongst the tribes had left few alive with hardly any resources. Erathis, a widow of the war who lost husband and four sons, saw the end approach and negotiated a peace. Her words convinced the remenants to divide the food and return to their tents to die.

That night Pelor came in the guise of a decrepid child. He stole into the tents to take the remaining morsels and test their resolve. He was caught and brought before Erathis to be judged and killed. She called again for the end of killing and the mob eventually dispursed.

Once she and the child were alone Erathis handed her last meal, a bruised and wilted apple, to the child who ate hungrily. He consumed every last piece of the flesh as she looked on. His meal complete he dug a small furrough in the parched soil and handed her the seeds from the apple.

Erathis stared for some time at the child and began to cry, knowing she and the child would die the next day. But the child looked at her with such hope that she soon relented and dropped the seeds into the furrough. The child covered the seeds and curled up next to her as night fell.

She was shaken awake the next morning to see the child was gone and in his place stood a beautiful tree, miraculously both in bloom and bearing ripe golden fruit. The golden tree became the symbol of human cooperation for centuries to come.

The Dawn Father returned to discuss the plight of humanity with his allies Moradin, Bahamut and Ioun. The Knowing Misstress suggested that humanity had lost its way when they were abandond by Zarus, "men need a positive role-model to demonstrate what they can become."

Pelor convinced each deity to bless humanity with a portion of their essence to create an exemplar. With luck their combined blessing would cleanse humanity of the corruption to which it succumed so easily.

Pelor returned to the tent of the widow Erathis in the guise of the wretched child and told her that she would give birth to a baby that would be a king, a priest, and a savior of humanity. He would lead the people in establishing peace, cooperation and order if the they would follow. Nine months later she gave birth to a son. She called him Pholtus.

## Age of Enlightenment

Pholtus exceeded every expectation. In his 80 years among humanity he established a dynasty of order and the foundations of the grand city of Fleeth. A new age of cooperation began. For the first time in human history other races began to trade and mingle. Alliances and agreements were created that lasted generations. Worship of evil gods was outlawed, including witchcraft and many arcane practisioners went under ground or fled.

Humanity entered a golden age of education, industry and prosperity as the gifts of the Gods took root in their minds and hearts.

When his mother, Erathis, began to wither with age, Pholtus gathered his people together and concecrated a successor from among his progeny. After many tearful goodbyes a shimmering doorway of pure light appeared and he and his mother passed through; out of history and into legend.

The reverence of Pholtus gradually turned to worship. Spreading first within the city of Fleeth, missionaries preached order and goodness to the reaches of the known world and became renowned for their tenacity and inflexiblity.
