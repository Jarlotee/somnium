title: 1145 BCY

The era from 1145 to 1143 marked a time of upheaval and turmoil.

Though the adventurers that were sent to find and kill the necromancer never returned it was assumed they were successful. 

In reality the necromancer was consolidating power and performing profane rituals. The heroes not only were defeated but also enslaved within the Soul Anchor, a phylactery specially crafted to control large amounts of undead with ease.

With the power of the Soul Anchor and additional alliances with the a priestess of Lloth the City of Fleeth crumbled.

The emperor was executed along with most of the clergy. The imperial family was able to escape, but was forever changed by the experience.

The people of Fleeth looked forward to torturous experiments and depravity, but within a week a miracle occurred.

The necromancer disappeared and his minions burned away in an explosion of light. At the center of the light stood the now resurrected heroes who had pursued the necromancer so many years past.
