title: What is Somnium?
---

Somnium, derived from the Latin word for dream, is a set of rules and concepts for tabletop role-playing games (TTRPG). Its system is designed to be rules-light in order to promote character development, imaginative flair, and storytelling. By design there are no classes, spells, kits, xp, or other automatic means of progressions. Instead guidelines are provided to facilitate that character creation and evolution process. Players are incentivized to engage in role-playing and explore the game world, rather than being constrained by a character sheet's predetermined abilities and attributes. 

Essentially, Somnium aims to revive the most favorable elements of the 70s and 80s, while discarding the unwieldy complexity and brutal mistakes of the past.

### Why another role-playing game?

The problem with modern Dungeons and Dragons is its digitization. Profit-seeking corporations required to maximize revenue must continue to print rules, modules, tools and other content. The more products they create the more they can sell you and the farther each table gets what makes TTRPG's magical, a dynamic shared story telling experience. This phenomenon has led to many TTRPG systems being perceived and played like video games. Consequently, our creativity and enjoyment are constricted by the boundaries of additional content. By adhering to a pre-scripted adventure that provides the illusion of choice, you are depriving yourself of the enchanting and dynamic universe that you, your game master and fellow adventurers create together.

Tabletop role-playing centers on the journey rather than the destination. It is not a game to be won; rather, it is a shared storytelling experience where each participant contributes their creativity, vision, and aspirations. Through that collective narrative, you bring dreams to life and create memories that will last a lifetime.


### Play Style

- The world is dangerous and your survival is not assured by an artificial construct of balanced encounters or level design. However, not every careless step or failed resistance check should mean an ignominious end. Scouting, planning and avoiding unnecessary combat is rewarded. An unbalanced world encourages creativity.

- While heroes can be categorized by archetypes or themes, we should avoid the tendency to mass manufacture them. They are and should be unique in terms of background, disposition, aesthetic and power. There are no classes just adventurers.

- Exploration, social encounters, mentors, tasks, trials, dungeons, politics, wars and puzzles should be used liberally and with variety to bring a rich and engaging story to life. Combat is only a small part of the story.

- Player characters have motivations and dreams. They should influence the tide of events rather than being swept up in them. There are no railroads, only adventure hooks.

- Logistics including training, followers, hirelings, apprentices, vehicles, fiefs and more give meaning and permanence to the world. Great people are defined by not just what they do, but what they hold and how they care for and interact with others. Meaning is derived from relationships more than feats of strength.

- Dice are primarily used to determine random effects, not hide or reveal secrets. Avoid the tendency of rolling for things like lore, insight, religion, etc. Include characters experience and training in narrative explanations and allow players to engage directly with the world.
