## Active Initiative

Somnium adopts the active initiative system:

1. **Who goes first?**: Whoever triggered the scene
2. **Take turns**: Take your turn, then pick who goes next
3. **End the round:** when everyone has gone, resolve effects and saving throws
4. **Start a new round:** continue until the conflict is resolved, the last to act in the prior round picks the first to act in the new round (including themselves).
5. **Change it up:** You can elect to interrupt at the end of a turn by spending a fate point or taking damage, if you have not yet acted that round.


## Attacking

There are no to-hit rolls. If you are in range, take a swing or fire away, you canâ€™t possibly miss! But be aware that your adversaries can do the same. A dozen goblins with daggers may not intimidate a knight sporting plate armor, but give a pair of orcs some two handed hammers and he might very well wet himself.

Roll the appropriate damage dice and apply any damage reduction, then tally it against Guard and Wounds.


## Damage Types

Armor and shields only protect you against physical damage (piercing, slashing, bludgeoning). Poison, Elemental and Psychic damage bypass guard and cause wounds (unless specifically mitigated with abilities or items).


## Bypassing Defenses with Called Shots

If you find yourself up against a wall against an armored foe you may need to change tactics. You can target a vulnerable spot in their defenses by using a called shot. Make a skill check with the appropriate weapon type based on your expertise on success you can bypass some of the enemies armor or potentially cause a temporary status effect. As a GM ensure that the called shot has an impact on the fight in a balanced way.
