### Weapon Styles

All characters are permitted to use any weapon. If the character is not proficient in a weapon style they roll an additional damage die and take the lowest result. All characters are proficient with basic weapons. As an expert the character can reroll one damage die. As a master they can reroll two damage dice.


### Armor Styles

All characters are permitted to use any armor. A character who is proficient with armor receives a +1 bonus to damage reduction of that style and reduces the movement penalty, if any, by 10â€™. An expert may reduce the noise penalty of the armor, if any, by one level.

A character must be at least proficient in the next lower tier of armor before they can become proficient in a heavier version.

_Optional Rule: A character who doffs their chain or plate armor for recreation or rest may continue to wear the underlying padding as if it were leather armor._


### Equipment

A character can gain proficiency in equipment such as weapons or armor from a proficient character or by reading a primer after spending 300 hours. Weapons and armor are categorized by style and the character is assumed proficient with all related equipment within that style.

A character proficient in a particular armor style will be able to use that style to better effect. See the armor section in equipment for detail.
