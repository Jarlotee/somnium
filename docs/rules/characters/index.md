title: Core Concepts

Every character is described by a set of attributes which, some of which indicate their relative strengths and weaknesses in mechanical terms.


## Attributes

The range of each of these attribute progress from:

| Name          | Resistance or Ability Check     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Debilitating  | 3d6 take lowest                 |
| Weak          | 2d6 take lowest                 |
| Ordinary      | 1d6                             |
| Exceptional   | 2d6 take highest                |
| Peerless      | 3d6 take highest                |


### Might

The character's ability to climb, jump, push, pull, lift, hold and strike.


### Precision

The character’s ability to tumble, dance, dodge, and aim.


### Vitality

The physical health, well being, and hardiness of the character.


### Wits

The rate at which the character recalls, processes, reads, learns and problem solves. Academic and emotional intelligence.


### Resolve

The character’s force of personality, dedication, and belief.


## Appearance

How the character is perceived by others including but not limited to:

- Race
- Height
- Weight
- Coloration (hair, eyes, skin)

> There are no rules that relate race to attributes. A sickly dwarf is just as likely to live in any world as a clumsy elf.

## Guard (Grit)

Indicate how much punishment a character can mitigate using defensive techniques and sheer will. A novice’s guard is equal to 3. Guard regenerates through the typical long rest mechanic. When a character runs out of guard the damage becomes a wound.


## Wounds (Flesh)

Indicate how much physical and psychological damage a character has taken. A novice’s maximum number of wounds are equal to 3. If a character continues to adventure or do other strenuous activities while wounded they GM can use the exhaustion rules to indicate consequence. One wound is recovered for each week of rest. When a character runs out of wounds they are dead.


## Fate Points

Indicate how much a character’s skill and luck affect the universe and the story. Each character will have access to a pool of fate points, growing with experience, while current fate points vary between usage and recovery. Fate points regenerate through taking breaks from adventuring. The GM may also award fate points in a similar fashion as inspiration.

### Abilities

Abilities are special skills granted by mentor training, character research, or powerful items.


## Damage Reduction

Armor and relevant protection magic provide damage reduction or additional guard. Leather armor reduces incoming damage by 1. A shield spell might provide 5 temporary Guard or reduce up to 2 incoming damage for a certain time period. Note that some abilities can bypass Guard or require a specific damage reduction type (e.g. fire, poison).


## Movement Rate

The rate at which your character moves during combat in terms of feet. Generally characters can move 40’ while using standard movement. Game masters should be flexible in movement rules especially when a fate point is used.

Overland and exploratory movement rate is subjective to the terrain and vehicles available and is at the discretion of the game master. As a rule of thumb, normal on-foot travel is 3 miles an hour or 24 miles a day.

## Proficiencies

Each character can invest time and energy into gaining with proficiency with tools, languages, and more.

Skills come in three levels, with each level requiring additional time, blood, and treasure to achieve.

### Competent
Indicates the skills and tools with which the character is experienced giving them a large chance of success.

### Expert
A character with expertise in a skill or tool doubles the benefit of being proficient. Expertise is rare; achieving expertise in multiple skills or tools becomes increasingly difficult. As a general guideline a character can only be an expert in two skills or tools.

### Mastery
A character with mastery in a skill or tool triples the benefit of being proficient. Mastery is particularly rare; achieving mastery in multiple skills or tools is impossible. Characters who achieve this level are often sought out as a teacher and mentor or offered partnership to start a related business. A character may only have one proficiency at Mastery level but may swap it for another. In that case the prior mastery becomes Expertise. As a general guideline the mastery of a skill or tool also takes up an expertise slot.


## Adventuring Level

The character’s sum total adventuring and life experience is denoted by their adventure level. Every character begins as a non-adventurer and advances as they overcome obstacles, learn and grow.

Classically, levels were expressed as experience points which were awarded based on gold acquired rather than monsters killed which promotes avoiding danger and creative game-play rather than combat. 

As a GM you are encouraged to create a list of objectives with various rewards. Once a number of adventures have completed or a milestone is reached an character attains the next adventuring level. This is usually a significant event that should have narrative flair.

The GM can use the following guide to understand character growth. Generally additional attribute gains should be based on where the player spends time and effort and not dolled out for discretionary spending. You may hand them out as rewards for training and other story milestones.

| Adventuring Level     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |  Fate Points     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| None                  | A character with little to no adventuring experience. Desperately trying to survive or find answers to a personal crisis.                                                                                                     | 0                |
| Neophyte              | A character who is just starting their adventuring career. Known through word of mouth and hungry for work.                                                                                                                   | 3                |
| Adept                 | A regional hero or villain, recognizable, respected or feared. Allies and enemies are forming, power, skill and wealth are accumulating. Attracting followers with no adventuring experience.                                 | 6                |
| Master                | A distinct and iconic seasoned veteran. Established and mentoring others as neophytes and adepts. Often has a stronghold, guild, tower, grove, etc. where they live and work. Sought after as councilors by important people. | 12               |
| Legend                | A great figure whispered in stories. Royalty would step lightly around these individuals.                                                                                                                                     | 21               |

The player can add to their Guard and Wounds through investing time in defensive skills.

## Alignment and Diametric Opposition

Characters have belief systems which often evolve over time. It is the players responsibility to role-play the reasoning behind their characters choices. 

If the table enjoys surprises (both positive and negative) aligned items and traps can introduce some fun. However player choice is still proffered at most tables. When introducing a trap or item that has an alignment effect describe the aura of the item or area in a way that is clear to the players. Describing how it feels and what power it could yield along with the sense of trade-off can introduce some drama. Who knows, maybe they can change the heart of a sentient weapon or using a cursed item out of desperation.
