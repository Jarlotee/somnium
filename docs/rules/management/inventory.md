title: Inventory
---

The number of items your character has available during an encounter is determined by your Wits; the total number of items your character can carry is determined by your Might. Any items that are considered _ready_ can be interacted with as at will. Items in the _carry_ slots are inaccessible during combat unless an action is taken to retrieve them.  Consult the following charts to determine a character ready/carry slots:

## Ready Slots

| Wits Attribute Level | Slots |
| -------------------- | ----- |
| Debilitating         | 2     |
| Weak                 | 3     |
| Ordinary             | 4     |
| Exceptional          | 5     |
| Peerless             | 6     |


## Carry Slots

| Might Attribute Level | Slots |
| --------------------- | ----- |
| Debilitating          | 6     |
| Weak                  | 8     |
| Ordinary              | 10    |
| Exceptional           | 12    |
| Peerless              | 14    |

> Things that are strapped to you in an unencumbered way do not fill a ready slot (e.g. clothes, armor, belts, etc.)

## Vehicles
