# Introduction


## What is Somnium?

Somnium, derived from the Latin word for dream, is a set of rules and concepts for tabletop role-playing (TTRPG). Its system is designed to be rules-light in order to promote character development, imaginative flair, and storytelling. Players ought to be motivated to engage in role-playing and explore the game world, rather than being constrained by a character sheet's predetermined abilities and attributes. Essentially, Somnium aims to revive the most favorable elements of the 70s and 80s, while discarding the unwieldy complexity and brutal mistakes of the past.


### Why another role-playing game?

As games such as Dungeons and Dragons have been around for decades, profit-seeking corporations have aimed to maximize revenue by expanding their cadre of merchandise, rules, and content. This phenomenon has led to many TTRPG systems being perceived and played  like video games. Consequently, our creativity and enjoyment are constricted by the boundaries of additional content. If you prefer a pre-scripted adventure that provides the illusion of choice, you are depriving yourself of the enchanting and dynamic universe that you, your game master and fellow adventurers create together.

Tabletop role-playing centers on the journey rather than the destination. It is not a game to be won; rather, it is a shared storytelling experience where each participant contributes their creativity, vision, and aspirations. Through that collective narrative, you bring our dreams to life and create memories that will last a lifetime.


### Play Style

- The world is dangerous and your survival is not assured by an artificial construct of balanced encounters or level design. However, not every careless step or failed resistance check should mean an ignominious end. Scouting, planning and avoiding unnecessary combat is rewarded.


- While heroes can be categorized by archetypes or themes, we should avoid the tendency to mass manufacture them. They are and should be unique in terms of background, disposition, aesthetic and power.


- Exploration, social encounters, mentors, tasks, trials, dungeons, politics, wars and puzzles should be used liberally and with variety to bring a rich and engaging story to life.


- Player characters have motivations and dreams. They should influence the tide of events rather than being swept up in them.


- Logistics including training, followers, hirelings, apprentices, vehicles, fiefs and more give meaning and permanence to the world. Great people are defined by not just what they do, but what they hold and how they care for and interact with others.


## Terminology


### Game Master

Also known as the Dungeon Master is the person who designs or interprets the setting and runs the sessions for the party. They are the final arbiter of rules and rulings and determine what happens as the result of player actions. 


### Player

A party member taking control of a character and voicing their thoughts, words and actions. 


### Character

An intelligent being with motivations and desires participating and living in the game setting. 


### Adventure

The shared story being created by the Game Master and Players, told over one or more sessions.


### Campaign

A series of one or more adventures involving a consistent setting, universe or party. 


### Non-player Character (NPC)

A character not played by one of the players, with whom the party will interact.


### Monster

A hostile character encountered by the party during an adventure, typically one fought or avoided.


## Dice Rolling Notation

Dice are used in many TTRPG’s to indicate fate or otherwise randomize results. Randomness creates both variety to play and storytelling and can indicate luck or fate.

Where:

- d4: 4-sided die
- d6: 6-sided die
- d8: 8-sided die
- d10: 10-sided die
- d12: 12-sided die
- d20: 20-sided die

When multiple dice should be rolled you will see the number of dice notated on the left side

Where:

- 2d4: Roll two, four-sided die
- 10d6: Roll then, six-sided die


### Percentile Dice (d100)

Percentile dice is typically made of a standard 10-sided die and a special 10-sided die with the following markings 00, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90.

Where:

- 00+1: 1
- 00+0: 10 
- 90+1: 1
- 90+0: 100 


### Advantage & Disadvantage

For a roll at advantage you will roll the requested dice and take the higher number. Rolling at disadvantage will require you to roll the requested dice and take the lower total.


### Emphasis Roll

An emphasis roll is called when the outcome of an action is deemed to be a catastrophic failure or success. Roll 3d6 and group the dice by 3 and below and 4 and above. The higher dice count indicates the result.


### Skill, Ability, and Resistance Checks

Generally these checks are expressed by rolling a certain number of D6 and taking the highest or lowest result. Where:

|              |                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Result**   | **Resistance or Ability Check** |
| Multiple 1’s | Critical Failure                |
| 1, 2, 3      | Failure                         |
| 4, 5         | Mostly Successful               |
| 6            | Complete Success                |
| Multiple 6’s | Critical Success                |


# Characters

Every character is described by a set of attributes which, some of which indicate their relative strengths and weaknesses in mechanical terms.


### Attributes


#### Might

The character's ability to climb, jump, push, pull, lift, hold and strike.


#### Precision

The character’s ability to tumble, dance, dodge, and aim.


#### Vitality

The physical health, well being, and hardiness of the character.


#### Wits

The rate at which the character recalls, processes, reads, learns and problem solves. Academic and emotional intelligence.


#### Resolve

The character’s force of personality, dedication, and belief.


### Attribute Range

The range of each of these attribute progress from:

|               |                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Name**      | **Resistance or Ability Check** |
| Debilitating  | 3d6 take lowest                 |
| Weak          | 2d6 take lowest                 |
| Ordinary      | 1d6                             |
| Exceptional   | 2d6 take highest                |
| Peerless      | 3d6 take highest                |


### Appearance

How the character is perceived by others including but not limited to:

- Race
- Height
- Weight
- Coloration (hair, eyes, skin)


### Adventuring Level

The character’s sum total adventuring and life experience is denoted by their adventure level. Every character begins as a Novice and advances as they overcome obstacles, learn and grow.

Classically, levels were expressed as experience points which were awarded based on gold acquired rather than monsters killed which incentivized avoiding danger and creative gameplay rather than combat. This game system recommends GM’s create a list of objectives with various rewards to incentivize story telling. Once a number of adventures have completed or a milestone is reached an individual can attain the next level.


### Guard (Grit)

Indicate how much punishment a character can mitigate using defensive techniques and sheer will. A novice’s guard is equal to 3. Guard regenerates through the typical long rest mechanic. When a character runs out of guard the damage becomes a wound.


### Wounds (Flesh)

Indicate how much physical and psychological damage a character has taken. A novice’s maximum number of wounds are equal to 3. If a character continues to adventure or do other strenuous activities while wounded they GM can use the exhaustion rules to indicate consequence. One wound is recovered for each week of rest. When a character runs out of wounds they are dead.


### Fate Points

Indicate how much a character’s skill and luck affect the universe and the story. You might spend a fate point to reroll a die in hopes of a different outcome or spend a point to summon a blinding light in front of an attacker that catches you off-guard. Each character will have access to a pool of fate points, growing with experience, while current fate points vary between usage and recovery. Fate points regenerate through taking breaks from adventuring. The GM may also award fate points in a similar fashion as inspiration. Rather than charges or static class abilities, techniques and magical items are powered by a character's fate points.


### Damage Reduction

Armor and relevant protection magic provide damage reduction or additional guard. Leather armor reduces incoming damage by 1. A shield spell might provide 5 temporary Guard or reduce up to 2 incoming damage for a certain time period. Note that some abilities can bypass Guard or require a specific damage reduction type (e.g. fire, poison).


### Movement Rate

The rate at which your character moves during combat in terms of feet. Generally characters can move 40’ while using standard movement. Game masters should be flexible in movement rules especially when a fate point is used.

Overland and exploratory movement rate is subjective to the terrain and vehicles available and is at the discretion of the game master. As a rule of thumb, normal on-foot travel is 3 miles an hour or 24 miles a day.


### Proficiencies

Indicates the skills and tools with which the character is experienced giving them a large chance of success.


### Expertises

A character with expertise in a skill or tool doubles the benefit of being proficient. Expertise is rare; achieving expertise in multiple skills or tools becomes increasingly difficult. As a general guideline a character can only be an expert in two skills or tools.


### Mastery

A character with mastery in a skill or tool triples the benefit of being proficient. Mastery is particularly rare; achieving mastery in multiple skills or tools is impossible. Characters who achieve this level are often sought out as a teacher and mentor or offered partnership to start a related business. A character may only have one proficiency at Mastery level but may swap it for another trained skill. In that case the prior mastery becomes Expertise. As a general guideline the mastery of a skill or tool also takes up an expertise slot.


### Abilities

Abilities are special skills granted by mentor training, character research, or powerful items. See the Abilities section below for more detail.


## Creating a Character

You will need a piece of paper, a character sheet, or another place to record the details of your character for future reference. 

It is recommended to start your adventure as a non-adventurer and to let the story and your character's motivations guide the development of your hero. A non-adventurer may select one skill or tool proficiency but would have minimal equipment, experience and no abilities.


### Attributes

It is recommended that you select at least one attribute as a weakness and select another attribute as exceptional. The rest of your attributes can remain ordinary.


### Note Guard and Wounds

Each character starts with 3 in Guard and 3 in Wounds.

_Optional rule: If a character has weakness or strength in the Resolve attribute you may treat it as a modifier to Guard. If a character has weakness or strength in the Vitality attribute you may treat it as a modifier to wounds._


### Select Proficiencies

Every character starts with one language proficiency (their own spoken language) and may select two additional proficiencies in languages, tools, or skills. See the proficiencies section for examples.


### Wealth and Equipment

Roll 3d6 x 10 silver pieces. You may spend as much of this money as desired on adventuring equipment by consulting the equipment list below. If you wish to purchase something not on the list, consult your GM on its availability and cost.


### Note Damage Reduction

If you have armor or other items that grant damage reduction note the reduction amount and type.


### Note Level and XP

Generally player characters start as Novice. Consult the progression section below.


### Name Character and Consider Motivations

Note the character's given name including any applicable clan or family name. If desired this name can be an alias if the character has a criminal history or is in hiding. Titles and nicknames should be avoided outside of the storytelling process.

Consider why your character is willing to risk life and limb doing things the average person would avoid. Do they have a debt to repay? Want to change the world? Seek fortune and glory? Motivation can give your character flavor and help role-play their present and future.


### Alignment and Diametric Opposition

Generally it is preferred to let a character navigate the complexity of choices without labeling them on a 3x3 alignment chart. D&D has used alignment as a proxy for motivation and temptation. A talisman of pure evil should be disgusting to a good natured character, and wielding it as a tool should have a negative effect. As a GM describe the traditionally aligned items or traps in direct terms so that players know what they are exposing themselves to. There is more fun and drama in trying to change the heart of a sentient weapon or using a cursed item out of desperation. 


## Progression

The GM can use the following guide to understand character growth. Generally additional attribute gains should be based on where the player spends time and effort and not dolled out for discretionary spending. You may hand them out as rewards for training and other story milestones.

|                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                  |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Adventuring Level** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Fate Points**  |
| None                  | A character with little to no adventuring experience. Desperately trying to survive or find answers to a personal crisis.                                                                                                     | 0                |
| Neophyte              | A character who is just starting their adventuring career. Known through word of mouth and hungry for work.                                                                                                                   | 3                |
| Adept                 | A regional hero or villain, recognizable, respected or feared. Allies and enemies are forming, power, skill and wealth are accumulating. Attracting followers with no adventuring experience.                                 | 6                |
| Master                | A distinct and iconic seasoned veteran. Established and mentoring others as neophytes and adepts. Often has a stronghold, guild, tower, grove, etc. where they live and work. Sought after as councilors by important people. | 12               |
| Legend                | A great figure whispered in stories. Royalty would step lightly around these individuals.                                                                                                                                     | 21               |

The player can add to their Guard and Wounds through investing time in defensive skills.


## Abilities


### Languages

A character knows one language which it has used to communicate since birth. Additional languages can be learned by training with another proficient character or reading a primer in said language for 500 hours. Writing equipment and/or a tablet must be present to learn written languages.


### Skills

A character can learn a new skill from a proficient character or by reading a primer after spending 400 hours.

You can use the list below as a reference but it is not an exhaustive list, add your own tailored to your character and setting.

#### Skill Ranges

The range of each of these attribute progress from:

|             |                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Name**    | **Resistance or Ability Check** |
| No Training | Roll 2d6 at disadvantage        |
| Proficiency | Roll 1d6                        |
| Expertise   | Roll 2d6 at advantage           |
| Mastery     | Roll 3d6 at advantage           |


### Weapon Styles

All characters are permitted to use any weapon. If the character is not proficient in a weapon style they roll an additional damage die and take the lowest result. All characters are proficient with basic weapons. As an expert the character can reroll one damage die. As a master they can reroll two damage dice.


### Armor Styles

All characters are permitted to use any armor. A character who is proficient with armor receives a +1 bonus to damage reduction of that style and reduces the movement penalty, if any, by 10’. An expert may reduce the noise penalty of the armor, if any, by one level.

A character must be at least proficient in the next lower tier of armor before they can become proficient in a heavier version.

_Optional Rule: A character who doffs their chain or plate armor for recreation or rest may continue to wear the underlying padding as if it were leather armor._


### Equipment

A character can gain proficiency in equipment such as weapons or armor from a proficient character or by reading a primer after spending 300 hours. Weapons and armor are categorized by style and the character is assumed proficient with all related equipment within that style.

A character proficient in a particular armor style will be able to use that style to better effect. See the armor section in equipment for detail.


### Beyond Proficiency

A character is able to attain expertise and finally mastery with any language, tool, skill, armor or weapon. 

To attain a higher level of proficiency a character needs to spend longer studying. As a rule of thumb it should take the character twice as long to gain expertise as proficiency and again twice as long to attain master over expertise. As a GM, remember that true masters are rare in any setting and that in addition to time, blood and treasure you should include the search for and acceptance of a master as story elements.


### Fate Abilities

As a character interacts with the world they will come across special items, tomes and mentors that can train and assist them in their journey.  As the character accepts and practices these abilities they transcend the normal constraints of humanity. To some degree these abilities define them as a hero. 

Inspiration can be drawn from tropes and traditional fantasy archetypes but variation and customization should be encouraged. Consult with your player to understand how their character is evolving and how it intersects with the setting and story. It is up to the GM to provide options and the player to accept and interact with those options. As a player you should remain flexible in the vision of your character and as a GM you should keep one eye on balance (i.e. not breaking the game) and the other on fulfilling the dreams of your players. Neither the player or the GM should force a specific build or flavor.

As a rule of thumb it is recommended that a character have access to two fate abilities for every adventuring level. Avoid the temptation of granting an ability explicitly because of a milestone or to keep a player artificially engaged. 

Each fate ability is powered by fate points. The more fate points spent the stronger the manifestation of said ability. Fate points can also be used to extend the normal bounds or conceptual design of the ability. For example making an ability harder to resist, more damaging, affect more creatures or a larger area.

If a creature is willing to accept the fate ability no roll is required. If the creature is unwilling the affected creature makes a resistance check using a relevant attribute.

You can use the following guidelines to create fate abilities for each character.

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Spending Fate

As discussed previously fate abilities are powered by fate points but there are many more ways a character can utilize their allotted fate. Generally a character can trade fate points for narrative and mechanical luck. As a GM be careful not to dismiss a character wanting to spend fate to turn the tides of the story in their favor. Consider how you can make the fate points create drama and interest and tell a better story. Here is a non-exhaustive list of ways a character can spend fate points:

- Add an additional die to a skill check or guarantee the best possible outcome
- Add an additional die to a resistance check, or guarantee the best possible outcome
- Reroll damage dice
- Move farther than would normally be allowed in a turn
- Receive knowledge, help, etc. from a patron
- Find a hidden door
- Extend the behavior or characteristics of a heroic ability or skill

As a GM you will have to use your judgment on how the fate points spent will affect the story and outcomes. Do your best to remain consistent. As a player you should be respectful of the story and the other participants.

# Combat


## Active Initiative

Somnium adopts the active initiative system:

1. **Who goes first?**: Whoever triggered the scene
2. **Take turns**: Take your turn, then pick who goes next
3. **End the round:** when everyone has gone, resolve effects and saving throws
4. **Start a new round:** continue until the conflict is resolved, the last to act in the prior round picks the first to act in the new round (including themselves).
5. **Change it up:** You can elect to interrupt at the end of a turn by spending a fate point or taking damage, if you have not yet acted that round.


## Attacking

There are no to-hit rolls. If you are in range, take a swing or fire away, you can’t possibly miss! But be aware that your adversaries can do the same. A dozen goblins with daggers may not intimidate a knight sporting plate armor, but give a pair of orcs some two handed hammers and he might very well wet himself.

Roll the appropriate damage dice and apply any damage reduction, then tally it against Guard and Wounds.


## Damage Types

Armor and shields only protect you against physical damage (piercing, slashing, bludgeoning). Poison, Elemental and Psychic damage bypass guard and cause wounds (unless specifically mitigated with abilities or items).


## Bypassing Defenses with Called Shots

If you find yourself up against a well armored foe you may need to change tactics. You can target a vulnerable spot in their defenses by using a called shot. Make a skill check with the appropriate weapon type based on your expertise on success you can bypass some of the enemies armor or potentially cause a temporary status effect. As a GM ensure that the called shot has an impact on the fight in a balanced way.


# Inventory

The number of items you have available during an encounter is determined by your Wits; the total number of items you can carry is determined by your Might. Any items that are considered _ready_ you can interact with as at will. Items in your _carry_ slots are inaccessible during combat unless you take an action to retrieve them.  Consult the following charts to determine a character ready/carry slots:

|                      |       |
| -------------------- | ----- |
| **Ready Slots**      |       |
| Wits Attribute Level | Slots |
| Debilitating         | 2     |
| Weak                 | 3     |
| Ordinary             | 4     |
| Exceptional          | 5     |
| Peerless             | 6     |

|                       |       |
| --------------------- | ----- |
| **Carry Slots**       |       |
| Might Attribute Level | Slots |
| Debilitating          | 6     |
| Weak                  | 8     |
| Ordinary              | 10    |
| Exceptional           | 12    |
| Peerless              | 14    |

Vehicles including mounts have their own ready/carry items slots at the GM’s discretion, you can use the following as a guideline:

|                      |             |             |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Slots by Vehicle** |             |             |
| Type                 | Ready Slots | Carry Slots |
| Pack Animal          | 2           | 20          |
| Horse                | 4           | 8           |
| Wagon                | 2           | 40          |
| Fishing Boat         | 6           | 35          |
| Sailing Ship         | 24          | 260         |
